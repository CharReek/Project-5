        <p class="text"> 80% of global deforestation is a result of agricultural production. Cotton is the most widely used
            natural fiber in fashion, it accounts for 2.5% of all agricultural areas. The fashion industry produces
            17-20% of all wastewater worldwide. Industrial water pollution comes from
            fabric manufacturing processes. And only 20% of globally produced wastewater receives proper treatment.

        <h3 class="subtitle"> Defends human rights</h3>
        <p class="text">Many fashion brands and retailers still use sweatshop-like conditions to produce their clothes. They
            practice inhumane manufacturing methods to cheaply produce low-quality and disposable clothing for
            high-street stores.Factory workers, mostly young women and even children, are paid below the legal
            minimum wage, forced to
            work long hours (up to 100 hours a week) in unsafe environments. They don't have access to healthcare or
            paid leaves.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle"> Reduces pollution and waste</h3>
        <p class="text">Clothing is piling up in landfills at an alarming rate. The fashion industry produces tons of waste and
            pollution every year. 16.9 million tons of used textile wastes are generated each year in the United
            States alone. Cheap synthetic materials such as polyester,
            nylon, or acrylic are especially dangerous. They aren't biodegradable and take up to thousands of years
            to decompose. As they break down, they release toxic gases, carbon dioxide, and methane, very potent
            greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere.</p>
