## Exsisting Features

* ### Nav Bar & Drop down menu 
I opted for a slightly thicker nav bar that includes a set of dropdown menus to help the user navigate the site. On smaller devices the nav bar collapses into a drop down section making it more accessible for moblie users. 
* ### Footer
I kept this small with links to social media platform. I kept this small due to having a thicker nav bar. 
* ### Header image 
I chose to go for a thinner hero image as to not overpower the home page. I kept the colours of the images with in the colour scheme.I went for a picture of trees to bring the users mind back to nature as the websites main focus is ecofriendly fashion.
* ### Benefits
This reassures the user that shopping sustanibly has major benefits. This could also help user that have not thought aboput being more sustainable a shock on to how much harm is being caused. This will also help users feel good about purchasing form the site knwoing all the things they could help. Thererfore this will bring in new Shopper and user. 
* ### New in
This section can help entise users to spend longer on the site by giving them a look into what is new in. 
* ### Tips
This section provies Users/ shopper tips on how they can become more substainable. This may give the shopper some ideas of what they can do to upcycle clothing they already own.
* ### Shop

## Future Features
There are mutiple features i would look to add in the future in order to provie the best and most effective user experience.
1. I would like to impliment a feature where other users can upload and sell any items they have. This way customers can swap items between each other.
2. Users be able to have visible profiles so they can follow each other and get notification on if their favourite user adds a new product. 
3. An FAQ page. This would be a space for users to look for answers to any questions they may have.
