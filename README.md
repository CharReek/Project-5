## Exsisting Features

* ### Nav Bar & Drop down menu 
I opted for a slightly thicker nav bar that includes a set of dropdown menus to help the user navigate the site. On smaller devices the nav bar collapses into a drop down section making it more accessible for moblie users. 
* ### Footer
I kept this small with links to social media platform. I kept this small due to having a thicker nav bar. 
* ### Header image 
I chose to go for a thinner hero image as to not overpower the home page. I kept the colours of the images with in the colour scheme.I went for a picture of trees to bring the users mind back to nature as the websites main focus is ecofriendly fashion.
* ### Benefits
This reassures the user that shopping sustanibly has major benefits. This could also help user that have not thought aboput being more sustainable a shock on to how much harm is being caused. This will also help users feel good about purchasing form the site knwoing all the things they could help. Thererfore this will bring in new Shopper and user.

2. Users be able to have visible profiles so they can follow each other and get notification on if their favourite user adds a new product. 
3. An FAQ page. This would be a space for users to look for answers to any questions they may have.

## Bugs & soultions
* Stripe payment not Processing.
One major bug i experienced during this project was during the implimentation of stripe payment.Ii found that my payments were being created but were not successful. I spent many hourse searching solutions and went to tutor support for help. in the end it turend out to be that the webhook was not pulling the correct results due to a spelling error in the code. This was a simple fix however reading the stripe documentation gave me a good insight into the different functionalities that can be inplimented with stripe and i learned alot about how to find fixes for bugs.
